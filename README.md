This website allows users to make buttons on the page to search for Giphs of topics of their choice. The theme is a "people search," but the search will work on whatever topic user puts into the input search field. 

The code uses AJAX calls to the GIPHY Developers site to append 10 still images (giphs) for each search submitted. The images animate when clicked and become still when clicked again using jQuery.
